      <h1>It's one of the most unique seasons in college football history. With the onslaught of Covid-19 it has been more than an inredible challenge just for the season to occur. Through some adversity, the season did indeed begin and for the most part it has been intact. There have been several postponements and in the case of one of our major contenders it may end up being quite the big deal. We shall offer all the information neccesary for you to decide who is worthy of the four playoff spots.</h1>

  <h1>Teams competing at 10-0 vs teams who are 5-0?</h1>
  <p>To compare these teams it is more difficult than ever before. In most common years you have <abbr title="Out of Conference">OOC</abbr> games to compare each conference. Currently that is not possible and every game is self contained to its region of the country. With these Unprecedented circumstances it is almost impossible to fairly and accurately judge all of these teams. And to top it all of some of the competitiors have only played half as many games as other contenders. This is some of the most insane differences between teams that we have ever seen. this, of course makes things more exciting than ever!</p>

  <h1>Interesting facts about how past teams faired at each ranking</h1>
  <p>Before last year, not a single number one seed was able to win the cfb playoffs. And currently the first team to be ranked third in the initial rankings has never made the playoffs period. The team that has faired the best in the playoffs has been the number two seed. three teams have won at the two seed ('15,'16, and '18), the Four seed has won twice ('14 and'17), the one seed once ('19) and the third seed has yet to win a title. Could this be the first one to do so?</p>
